following instructions exactly as they are given is important in learning how to code because if you mess up sometimes you have to go back and do 
everything all over again. If you dont follow instructions you may harm or break what you are trying to code. if you ndont follow instruction you may not be able to code again.

computer science impacts my life with gaming. this is becasue of all of the coding that is done for them. 
computer science is what helps with the code by them learing how to do it. that is how computer science impacts my life.

Coding teaches you to think logically. Coding skills have become valuable across various industries. While it's beneficial for tech-related careers, coding enhances problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity, which are applicable in diverse fields like finance, healthcare, and even the arts. Coding provides a unique platform for artistic expression.

AI can benefit transportation and logistics by helping meet the growing demand for faster, more reliable deliveries. job automation leading to unemployment, bias in algorithms due to skewed training data, cybersecurity threats from malicious actors exploiting AI vulnerabilities, privacy violations from data collection, lack of transparency in decision-making processes, potential for social manipulation, and the possibility of unintended consequences from complex AI systems.

if sensitive data falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to fraud, identity theft, or similar harms. use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, regularly review your privacy settings, avoid sharing sensitive information directly, carefully manage who can access your content, and utilize features like private repositories on GitHub to restrict visibility when necessary. it can happen when you're not fully considering the audience or the potential consequences of sharing a particularly vulnerable or private detail about your life. use dedicated collaboration platforms with access controls, share only necessary information, maintain separate personal and professional online identities, utilize encryption for sensitive data, and clearly communicate your privacy boundaries with collaborators; always being mindful of what information you disclose publicly and who you share it with.

Nineteen terrorists from al-Qaeda hijacked four commercial airplanes, deliberately crashing two of the planes into the upper floors of the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center complex and a third plane into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.

Technology make's food more affordable and accessible during the holiday season by being abe to ship it to your houce so you dont have to get in fights with people who want the same thing. There are many negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply. one being that is you do ship it then it might get to you when it is already expired. Another is that we rely on it too much that we can use it to find recipe that dont even work and wast food.

Advanced Robotics. Robotics technology has evolved to create machines that can perform complex tasks autonomously or with minimal human oversight. Robotics Technologies for Multitasking. Impact: The next generation of robots will have the ability to perform multiple tasks. Robotics will soon allow for better interactions between humans and robots. What concerns me about this is that fact that some day robots will take over our jobs and we will have nothing to make money. This can help with the feild i am intrested in by having robots look inside places that officers can not go in like a burning building, even though there are fire fighters for that. we would need to watch how it moves and thinks because if we dont then we might make a mistake somewere along the lina and it wont work the way we want it to do.

What the term "brain rot" meant to me is something that is in your hear that isnt good for you but you cant stop thinking bout it. The media hads its ups and downs this year but to me it was a mid way impact. The word "slop" and "lore" connect with my experience with technology this year by connecting me to games that have what the words mean. it's possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding â€œbrain rot" by not paying attenion to it or ignoring it. you can do this by looking at stuff that dosent include that stuff or by looking at the things that you like.

I enjoyed the codeing. Everything is fine and dosent need to be improved. Nothing comes to mind for thing i would like to learn in this class. I dont really intend to go for any certifications in this class.

My thoughts on this shift is that i am curious on how that will do that. I think that AI will limit workers for jobs because they can make the AI better than the workers. I can prepare my self by doing things that AI cant take over for work.

I think that government intervention impact technology companies and their users by them blocking things that they dont like. So because of this tik tok is banned. What tik tok could have done was made a code that detecs if something is age apropriate or not and can block it depending on the user. this probebly owuld have made tik tok not get banned.
If i was a develeper at tik tok i would add somthing that would do what i talked about. i would make a code that makes things restricted for certin ages. what i can take from this and apply to any of my projects is
