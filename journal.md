following instructions exactly as they are given is important in learning how to code because if you mess up sometimes you have to go back and do 
everything all over again. If you dont follow instructions you may harm or break what you are trying to code. if you ndont follow instruction you may not be able to code again.

Technology make's food more affordable and accessible during the holiday season by being abe to ship it to your houce so you dont have to get in fights with people who want the same thing. There are many negative effects of relying on technology for our food supply. one being that is you do ship it then it might get to you when it is already expired. Another is that we rely on it too much that we can use it to find recipe that dont even work and wast food.

Advanced Robotics. Robotics technology has evolved to create machines that can perform complex tasks autonomously or with minimal human oversight. Robotics Technologies for Multitasking. Impact: The next generation of robots will have the ability to perform multiple tasks. Robotics will soon allow for better interactions between humans and robots. What concerns me about this is that fact that some day robots will take over our jobs and we will have nothing to make money. This can help with the feild i am intrested in by having robots look inside places that officers can not go in like a burning building, even though there are fire fighters for that. we would need to watch how it moves and thinks because if we dont then we might make a mistake somewere along the lina and it wont work the way we want it to do.

What the term "brain rot" meant to me is something that is in your hear that isnt good for you but you cant stop thinking bout it. The media hads its ups and downs this year but to me it was a mid way impact. The word "slop" and "lore" connect with my experience with technology this year by connecting me to games that have what the words mean. it's possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot" by not paying attenion to it or ignoring it. you can do this by looking at stuff that dosent include that stuff or by looking at the things that you like.

I think that government intervention impact technology companies and their users by them blocking things that they dont like. So because of this tik tok is banned. What tik tok could have done was made a code that detecs if something is age apropriate or not and can block it depending on the user. this probebly owuld have made tik tok not get banned.
If i was a develeper at tik tok i would add somthing that would do what i talked about. i would make a code that makes things restricted for certin ages. what i can take from this and apply to any of my projects is

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This means that if you measure the state of one entangled particle, you can instantly know the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart. This concept challenges our classical understanding of physics and raises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and information.

Last Friday, our class had the opportunity to interact with a substitute teacher, and it was clear that our behavior significantly influenced their experience. While some students were respectful and engaged, others were less cooperative, which likely made the substitute's job more challenging. It’s important to recognize that substitutes often step into a difficult situation, trying to maintain the same level of learning and discipline as the regular teacher. By not fully cooperating, we may have created an environment that was stressful and disheartening for them. I can imagine that by the end of the day, the substitute felt a mix of frustration and disappointment, wishing for a more supportive atmosphere to work in.

The integration of advanced technologies into March Madness has undeniably transformed my perception of the tournament, making it a more immersive and engaging experience. The use of artificial intelligence to predict game outcomes and create perfect brackets adds a layer of intrigue, as fans can now analyze data-driven insights that were previously unavailable. However, while these predictions can enhance the excitement of making informed choices, they also risk detracting from the unpredictability that is the hallmark of March Madness. The thrill of upsets and Cinderella stories is what makes the tournament so captivating, and relying too heavily on AI-driven forecasts could lead to a more formulaic approach to bracket-building, potentially diminishing the joy of surprise that comes with each game.
Moreover, the role of social media platforms and streaming services has revolutionized how fans engage with the tournament, creating a more connected and interactive viewing experience. Real-time updates, highlights, and fan reactions shared across platforms like Twitter and Instagram allow for a communal atmosphere, where discussions and debates can unfold instantaneously. This shift impacts the traditional viewing experience by fostering a sense of immediacy and involvement that was previously limited to in-person attendance or scheduled broadcasts. As a result, my connection to the games has deepened; I find myself not only watching the matches but also participating in a broader conversation that enhances my appreciation for the sport. The combination of AI predictions and social media engagement has created a dynamic landscape for March Madness, blending technology with the raw emotion of college basketball in a way that keeps fans more engaged than ever.

AI tools have the potential to significantly enhance my study habits and test preparation, especially for standardized tests like the STAAR. One of the most beneficial aspects of AI tutors is their ability to provide personalized learning experiences tailored to my specific needs and learning pace. For instance, an AI tutor could analyze my strengths and weaknesses in various subjects, offering targeted practice questions and resources that focus on areas where I need improvement. Additionally, features like instant feedback on practice tests and the ability to explain complex concepts in different ways would help reinforce my understanding and retention of the material. This level of customization could make studying more efficient and less overwhelming, allowing me to approach the test with greater confidence.
Personally, the most useful feature of an AI tutor for me would be its ability to help me stay organized and manage my study schedule effectively. With the demands of schoolwork and extracurricular activities, it can be challenging to find the right balance and allocate sufficient time for test preparation. An AI tool that could create a structured study plan, set reminders for important deadlines, and track my progress would be invaluable. I would definitely consider using such a resource, as it would not only streamline my study process but also alleviate some of the stress associated with preparing for high-stakes tests. By leveraging AI to enhance my study habits, I believe I could improve my performance and achieve better results on the STAAR.

The bans on student cell phone use and social media access in Florida schools can be seen as both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the perspective taken. On one hand, proponents argue that these measures can significantly reduce distractions in the classroom, allowing students to focus more on their studies and engage more fully with their teachers and peers. By limiting access to social media, schools may also create a safer environment that mitigates the risks of cyberbullying and social anxiety, which can be exacerbated by constant online interactions. However, opponents raise valid concerns about the potential negative impact on student autonomy and the ability to communicate during emergencies. In a world where technology is deeply integrated into daily life, completely banning cell phones may hinder students' ability to develop responsible digital citizenship and critical thinking skills regarding technology use.

If such policies were implemented in my school, I would respond with a mix of understanding and advocacy for a balanced approach. While I recognize the need to minimize distractions and promote a focused learning environment, I would advocate for a policy that allows for controlled and responsible use of cell phones, particularly during breaks or in designated areas. This could help students learn to manage their technology use while still having access to it for emergencies or important communications. Additionally, I would encourage discussions around digital literacy and the importance of navigating social media responsibly, rather than simply restricting access. Ultimately, the goal should be to foster an environment that prioritizes both safety and learning while preparing students for the realities of a technology-driven world.

It is highly improbable that 100 unarmed people could defeat a silverback gorilla. Silverback gorillas are incredibly strong, with bite forces exceeding 1,300 PSI and the ability to lift up to 4,000 pounds. Even with 100 people, the gorilla's strength, agility, and natural weaponry (teeth and powerful limbs) would make it a formidable opponent, leading to severe injuries among the humans.The Viral Challenge: Responsibility and EducationMaking this kind of challenge go viral is irresponsible due to the potential for harm and misinformation. While some might see it as a thought experiment about strategy and teamwork, many could misunderstand the true danger and brutality of such a confrontation. This highlights how online trends can prioritize entertainment over education, spreading sensational ideas without considering the ethical or practical implications.

The "Chromebook Challenge" is an example of unethical behavior because it puts both individuals and school property at risk. As digital citizens, we have a responsibility to use technology safely and ethically, understanding that our actions have real-world consequences.Ethical Implications and ResponsibilitiesThe "Chromebook Challenge," which involves inserting objects into USB ports, is clearly unethical. This is because it can lead to physical damage to school property, such as Chromebooks, and poses a significant safety risk due to the potential for electrical fires. As students, we are entrusted with valuable resources, and intentionally damaging them is a breach of that trust. Furthermore, such actions can lead to disciplinary consequences, including suspension or expulsion, as schools have policies in place to protect their equipment and ensure a safe learning environment.Real-World Consequences and Responsible Tech UseTo someone who views the "Chromebook Challenge" as a harmless joke, it's crucial to explain the real-world consequences. Damaging school property ultimately affects everyone, as it can lead to increased costs for repairs or replacements, which may result in fewer resources available for educational programs. More importantly, the risk of electrical fires can endanger lives and cause serious injuries. Responsible tech use means understanding the potential impact of our actions and prioritizing safety and respect for property. It also means being a positive influence and discouraging others from participating in dangerous or destructive behaviors.
